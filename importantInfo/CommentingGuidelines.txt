#    takes in an input file, output file, the variable on which to aggregate, the method to use (mean, min, max),
#    the interval on which to aggregate (day, month, season, or year), and the outtime to set (the date/time of interval
#    to set the aggregate result). The output file is then a NetCDF with the aggregate data
