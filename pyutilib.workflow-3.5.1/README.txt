pyutilib.workflow README
========================

This Python package includes a simple workflow management system.  This
is inspired by other open-source workflow tools, such as pyphant and
spiffworkflow.  What distinguished pyutilib.workflow is that it is
not strongly dependent on the datatypes being managed (e.g. the use of 
scipy or numpy types).  Also, pyutilib.workflow is designed to support
Python-level definitions of the workflow (rather than a separate XML
specification).

See `Managing Scientific Workflows in Python with pyutilib.workflow <https://software.sandia.gov/svn/public/pyutilib/pyutilib.workflow/trunk/doc/workflow/workflow.pdf>`_ for a detailed description of PyUtilib workflows and examples of their use.
